            To use the clipboard, you call member functions of the global {Wx::Clipboard} object passed to the block for {Wx::Clipboard.open}.
            See the {Wx::DataObject} Overview for further information.
            Call {Wx::Clipboard.open} to get ownership of the (global) clipboard and execute the given block. You now 
            own the clipboard passed to the given block. Call {Wx::Clipboard#set_data} to put data on the clipboard, or 
            {Wx::Clipboard#get_data} to retrieve data from the clipboard. The clipboard is closed and ownership 
            relinquished when the block returns. You should keep the clipboard open only momentarily.
            For example:
            
            ```ruby
              # Write some text to the clipboard
              Wx::Clipboard.open do |clip|
                # This data object is held by the clipboard
                clip.place(Wx::TextDataObject.new("Some text"))
                # or alternatively
                # clip.set_data(Wx::TextDataObject.new("Some text"))
              end
            
              # Read some text
              data = Wx::TextDataObject.new
              Wx::Clipboard.open do |clip|
                 if clip.supported?(Wx::DF_TEXT)
                   clip.fetch(data) # or clip.get_data(data)
                 end
              end
              Wx.message_box(data.get_text)
            ```
            
            On GTK, the clipboard behavior can vary depending on the configuration of the end-user's machine. In order 
            for the clipboard data to persist after the window closes, a clipboard manager must be installed. Some 
            clipboard managers will automatically flush the clipboard after each new piece of data is added, while others 
            will not. The {Wx::Clipboard#flush} function will force the clipboard manager to flush the data.
