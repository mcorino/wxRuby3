            A variant's value can be changed at run time, possibly to a different type of value.
            In wxRuby Wx::Variant is the only available Wx variant class (unlike in C++) and almost exclusively for
            use in combination with the property grid classes (see the {Wx::PG} module).

            By default Wx::Variant can store values of type bool, {Integer}, {Float}, {String}, {Time} (or {Date} / {DateTime}), {Array} of {String}, 
            {Array} of {Wx::Variant}, {Wx::Font}, {Wx::Colour} and {Wx::ColourPropertyValue}.
            In addition Wx::Variant can store any Ruby {Object}.
            
            An optional name member is associated with a Wx::Variant.
            
            In wxRuby Wx::Variant also provides the standard conversion methods #to_i, #to_s and #to_f for supported
            value types. In case of incompatible value types these methods will raise a {TypeError} exception.

          If the variant contains an arbitrary Ruby {Object}, the value type returned is the result of `variant.get_object.class.name`.
