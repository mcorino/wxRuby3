THE FOLLOWING IS NOT PART OF THE LICENSE, NOR IS IT LEGAL ADVICE!


wxRuby3 and wxWidgets
--------------------
If you distribute (your) wxRuby3 (application) with a binary copy of wxWidgets,
you are bound to the requirements of the copy of wxWidgets within. Fortunately,
those requirements do not impose any serious restrictions.


wxWidgets License Summary (from the wxWidgets README)
-----------------------------------------------------
In summary, the licence is LGPL plus a clause allowing unrestricted 
distribution of application binaries. To answer a FAQ, you don't have to 
distribute any source if you wish to write commercial applications using 
wxWidgets.


Required Credits and Attribution
--------------------------------

Generally, neither wxWidgets nor wxRuby3 require attribution, beyond
retaining existing copyright notices. However, if you build your own 
custom wxWidgets library, there may be portions that require specific 
attributions or credits, such as TIFF or JPEG support. See the wxWidgets 
README and license files for details.
